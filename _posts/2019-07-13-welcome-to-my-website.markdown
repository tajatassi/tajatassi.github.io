Hello There! My name is Taj Atassi. I am a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Chicago. I am a developer and photographer. My interests include Islamic Studies, Software Engineering, and photography. 

This website will be used as a medium to speak about topics related to my interests. I will talk about the different projects I am working on and more. I may write snippets of code shown below. I do welcome you to my new site and I look forward to adding more to this.

Snippets of code appear like:
```javascript
// file.js
const Tajine = require('Tajine');

let taj = Tajine({
	id: '1234',
	secret: 'abcd'
});

// Execute the thing
taj.execute(id, amount)
	.then(function (data) {
		console.log("execution complete");
		return -999;
	})
```

Check me out on [Twitter][twitter], [Instagram][instagram], and [LinkedIn][linkedin]. This website is powered by [Jekyll][jekyll] with the theme [plainwhite][plainwhite]. Special thanks to the respective authors.
